    <h1>Nick Dandakis</h1>
    <p>
      I make computers do things for a living.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's pretty dope.
    </p>
    <p>
      And because I make computers do things for a living, <br />
      I don't feel like coding some elaborate site for my personal brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can make use of my time in a much better way.
